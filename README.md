## Question 1

Choose an organisation for the group as the context for your answers in this assignment; address the following questions:

You may refer to the corporate website of the organisation chosen.

## Question 1(b) (40 marks)

Use Tableau to plot a visualisation chart for each of the measures suggested in part (a) (total 8 charts) and provide a screenshot of each chart with a meaningful title. 

Discuss why each chart is appropriate for its corresponding measure and a conclusion drawn in 4-5 lines below each respective screenshot of the chart. (Maximum word count: 500 words)

You will need to create your own datasets using the information on corporate website as a starting point, but you can also obtain relevant data from other online sources (if available).

## 1. Total Revenue (Financial Measure 1)

A bar chart is the ideal chart because it visualises the year-on-year change of the total revenue where it experienced slight increases from 2015 to 2019. 

An insight identified is the Total Revenue sharply grew by 16% between 2022 and 2021 (DBS, n.d.). DBS Bank experienced its largest total revenue in 2022 at 16.5 billion and lowest of 10.8 billion in 2015 (Statista, 2023).

## 2. Return on Equity (ROE) (Financial Measures 2)

A line chart is the ideal chart because it shows how DBS ROE has fluctuated between 2009 and 2023 and the trend line indicates that there has been a linear increase. 

The ROE performance has been volatile as there are no obvious upward or downward trends. 

The ROE that began with a value of 7.23% has increased sharply to 16.80% by 2023 which represents an overall positive trend.
